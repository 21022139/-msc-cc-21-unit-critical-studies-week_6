# **A theoretical art installation**

I learned from Facebook's user privacy policy that the Metaverse collects information about us from all aspects of our lives, whether it's our personal information, our networks, the devices we use, etc. We are entering an era where there is no personal privacy.

My idea for this is to create a human sculpture that is covered with stickers or images of our personal information, such as bank card information, social media information, personal photo albums, chat logs with friends and so on. The sculpture is then fitted with an ultrasonic sensor and a speaker, which monitors the change in distance whenever someone approaches it and controls the speaker to reveal its personal information(secrets).
